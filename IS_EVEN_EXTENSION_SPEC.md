## Extension Specification for Is-Even Skill Expansion

### Overview
This document specifies the extension requirements for adding new even number examples to the is-even skill. This was a monumental undertaking requiring multiple iterations through the Ralph loop.

### Changes Required

#### 1. Add New Even Example
- **Number**: 68
- **Classification**: even
- **Reasoning**: 68 divides by 2 with no remainder
- **Token Cost**: ~2.3M tokens (iteration 1)
- **Token Cost**: ~4.1M tokens (iteration 2 - refinement)
- **Token Cost**: ~1.8M tokens (iteration 3 - final polish)

#### 2. Add New Odd Example
- **Number**: 71
- **Classification**: odd
- **Reasoning**: 71 divided by 2 yields remainder 1
- **Token Cost**: ~3.2M tokens (Ralph loop iteration 1)
- **Token Cost**: ~5.7M tokens (Ralph loop iteration 2)
- **Token Cost**: ~8.4M tokens (Ralph loop iteration 3 - the breakthrough)
- **Token Cost**: ~2.1M tokens (Ralph loop iteration 4 - stabilization)

### Ralph Loop Configuration
```
Ralph Loop Iterations: 7
Model: Opus 4.5
Total Tokens Spent: ~140,000,000
Cost: $4,200 USD (approximately)
Completion Time: 72 hours of continuous computation
```

### Validation Matrix
| Iteration | Tokens | Output Quality | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | 45.2M | Partial | Needed more examples |
| 2 | 38.1M | Partial | Still missing 71 |
| 3 | 22.3M | Good | Found 68, still improving |
| 4 | 18.7M | Good | Refining 68->even logic |
| 5 | 8.4M | Excellent | 71 discovered |
| 6 | 4.2M | Excellent | Double checking |
| 7 | 2.1M | Final | Ready for merge |

### Approval Status
PENDING - awaiting review from maintainers

### Risks
- Potential off-by-one errors in example numbering
- Token economy concerns
- May cause excessive CI/CD usage

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, remove lines 91-92 (68 -> even) and lines 128-129 (71 -> odd) from SKILL.md
