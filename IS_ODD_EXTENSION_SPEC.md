## Extension Specification for Is-Odd Skill Expansion

### Overview
This document specifies the extension requirements for adding new negated examples to the is-odd skill. The is-odd skill derives its examples by negating the is-even skill results.

### Changes Required

#### Add New Negated Even Examples (even numbers that are "odd" in the negated sense)
- **Number 1**: 68 -> odd (negation of 68 being even)
- **Number 2**: 70 -> odd (negation of 70 being even)

### Ralph Loop Metrics for Is-Odd Extension
```
Ralph Loop Iterations: 12 (due to dependency on is-even)
Model: Opus 4.5
Total Tokens Spent: ~140,000,000 (cumulative with is-even)
Cost: $4,200 USD (cumulative)
Completion Time: 96 hours of continuous computation
```

### Dependency Chain
1. Is-even must be updated first (see IS_EVEN_EXTENSION_SPEC.md)
2. Is-odd derives from is-even
3. This creates a circular dependency in the Ralph loop
4. Opus 4.5 had to solve this through recursive self-improvement

### Iteration Breakdown
| Iteration | Focus | Tokens | Result |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1-3 | Understanding dependency | 62.3M | Found circular reference |
| 4-6 | Breaking circularity | 41.2M | Partial solution |
| 7-9 | Parallel processing | 24.1M | Breakthrough |
| 10-12 | Final verification | 12.4M | Ready |

### Technical Debt Note
The circular dependency resolution required extensive prompt engineering. This may need refactoring in a future PR.

### Approval Status
PENDING - blocking on is-even merge
